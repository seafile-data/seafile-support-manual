# Upgrade to Pro 7.0

Since seafile-pro 7.0.0, we have upgraded Elasticsearch to 5.6. As Elasticsearch 5.6 relies on the Java 8 environment and can't run with root, you need to run Seafile with a non-root user and upgrade the Java version.

## Upgrade the Java version

In order to upgrade from 6.3.x to 7.0.x, you may need to upgrade the JDK version.

Run the following command to view the current Java version information:

```
java -version

```

If the current JDK version is 1.7.0, then you need to upgrade to 1.8.0. To upgrade to openjdk-1.8.0, refer to the following command:

```
# For CentOS
yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk

```

```
# For Ubuntu
apt-get install openjdk-8-jre

```

---

**In addition, if you previously ran Seafile with root, you would need to run Seafile with a non-root user in order to use search functionality after upgrading to 7.0.x. If Seafile is already running with a non-root user, you can do the upgrade directly.**

## Switch user if you are using root to run Seafile

It is recommended that you run Seafile with the `seafile` user. For specific operations, please refer to the following process:

**Assume that the Seafile installation directory is:** `/opt/seafile`

**Assume that the Seafile data storage path is:** `/opt/seafile/seafile-data`

### Stop Seafile Service

You need to stop the currently running seafile process first.

```
cd /opt/seafile/seafile-server-latest
./seafile.sh stop
./seahub.sh stop

```

### Create seafile user

Create a system account to run the Seafile service. The suggested user name is seafile：

```
useradd --system --comment "seafile" seafile --create-home --home-dir  /home/seafile

```

### Modify directory permissions

Modify the owner and group of the Seafile installation directory and the Seafile data storage directory to seafile:

```
chown -R seafile.seafile /opt/seafile
chown -R seafile.seafile /opt/seafile/seafile-data
chown -R seafile.seafile /tmp/seafile-office-output

```

### Start the service

```
su - seafile
cd /opt/seafile/seafile-server-latest
./seafile.sh start
./seahub.sh start

```

### Modify the startup scripts

**If you used the systemd manager to implement boot-up：**

* You need to modify `/etc/systemd/system/seafile.service`：


```
[Unit]
Description=Seafile Server
After=network.target mariadb.service

[Service]
ExecStart=/opt/seafile/seafile-server-latest/seafile.sh start
ExecStop=/opt/seafile/seafile-server-latest/seafile.sh stop
User=seafile
Group=seafile
Type=oneshot
RemainAfterExit=yes

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

```

And `/etc/systemd/system/seahub.service`：

```
[Unit]
Description=Seafile Seahub
After=network.target seafile.service

[Service]
ExecStart=/opt/seafile/seafile-server-latest/seahub.sh start
ExecStop=/opt/seafile/seafile-server-latest/seahub.sh stop
User=seafile
Group=seafile
Type=oneshot
RemainAfterExit=yes

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

```

Reload the systemd manager configuration：

```
systemctl daemon-reload

```

**If you used the init script to implement boot-up:**

You need to modify `/etc/init.d/seafile-server`：

```
#!/bin/bash

                exit 1
        ;;
esac

```

### Upgrade Seafile

Stop running the current seafile service：

```
su - seafile
cd /opt/seafile/seafile-server-latest
./seafile.sh stop
./seahub.sh stop

```

Download the seafile-pro 7.0.x package and extract it to the Seafile installation directory `/opt/seafile`; then execute the upgrade script:

```
cd /opt/seafile/seafile-pro-server-7.0.x/upgrade/
./upgrade_6.3_7.0.sh

```

After the upgrade script is successfully executed, start the Seafile service:

```
cd /opt/seafile/seafile-server-latest
./seafile.sh start
./seahub.sh start

```

## Features Modification

### Encrypted libraries

Note, to enable using new encrypted libraries with different salt for different libraries, you need to add the following configuration to seahub_setting.py

```
ENCRYPTED_LIBRARY_VERSION = 3

```

Currently the mobile clients and desktop clients does not supported new version of encrypted library yet. After we upgrade the clients, we will make the setting as default.

### File history

Recording file history to database for fast access is enabled by default for 'Markdown, .txt, ppt, pptx, doc, docx, xls, xlsx'. To disable the feature or to modified the file list, you can add the following settings to seafevents.conf

```
[FILE HISTORY]
enabled = false
suffix = md,txt,...

```

After enable the feature, the old histories version for markdown, doc, docx files will not be list in the history page. (Only new histories that stored in database will be listed) But the users can still access the old versions in the library snapshots.

For file types not listed in the `suffix` , histories version will be scanned from the library history as before.

### File activities

The file activities feature are redesigned. We use a new database table to record file activities. The old activities will not be displayed.

### Wikis

In version 6.3, users can create public or private Wikis. In version 7.0, private Wikis is replaced by column mode view. Every library has a column mode view. So users don't need to explicitly create private Wikis.

Public Wikis are now renamed to published libraries.

There are two role permissions that control whether a user can create public Wikis, share link permission and publish library permission. A user must have both the permissions to be able to use public Wikis.

## Common Problems

### Not able to open Markdown file

If after upgrading to 7.0, you are not able to open Markdown file and if your seahub.log containing the following error, it is caused by you forgot to migrate file comment when you upgrade to 6.3 version.

You can delete the table base_filecomment and recreate the table.

```
CREATE TABLE `base_filecomment` (
  
    `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `author` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  
    `comment` longtext NOT NULL,
  `created_at` datetime NOT NULL,
  
    `updated_at` datetime NOT NULL,
  `uuid_id` char(32) NOT NULL,
  
    `detail` longtext NOT NULL,
  `resolved` tinyint(1) NOT NULL,
  
    PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  KEY `base_filecomment_uuid_id_4f9a2ca2_fk_tags_fileuuidmap_uuid` (`uuid_id`),
  
    KEY `base_filecomment_author_8a4d7e91` (`author`),
  
    KEY `base_filecomment_resolved_e0717eca` (`resolved`),
  
    CONSTRAINT `base_filecomment_uuid_id_4f9a2ca2_fk_tags_fileuuidmap_uuid` FOREIGN KEY (`uuid_id`) REFERENCES `tags_fileuuidmap` (`uuid`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;
